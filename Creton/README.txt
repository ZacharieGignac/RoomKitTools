TEST 2 - Now with converted crestron drivers support, kind of.

Zacharie Gignac says:

Step 1: Edit the config.js to your needs
Step 2: run node eapstart.js
Step 3: ???
Step 4: Profit!

If you need me to convert a crestron display driver, shoot, i'll do it. The app is not ready yet.

Also, don't forget this is just a test. Enjoy!
